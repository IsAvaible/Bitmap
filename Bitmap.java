/* Looking back, what should have been made different? <br>
 * - Instead of implementing the pattern via Strings (pattern-names), own Object builders for each pattern would have been clearer. <br>
 * For example: {@code Bitmap.Pattern grid = Bitmap.Patterns.Grid(<args>)} <br>
 * - Subclass ColorProvider instead of checking the Object argument each time. <br>
 * - The IllegalArgumentExceptions are informative, but not if one needs to catch a specific one. Own Exceptions and a more diverse use of them. <br>
 * - Outsource some of the code (for example the classes), to make the code less cluttered. <br>
 * - Overloads are pretty annoying especially on a large scale, find alternative way. <br>
 * - <s>Gradients should be able to scale automatically, declaring from and to each time can be a hassle.</s> Implemented <br>
 * - Uniform naming, <s> Object argument should always be called color_provider (instead of color) </s> <br>
 * - <s>Pattern should not be too powerful, outsource the fast pattern handler</s> I don't think that pattern is a god object, or too powerfull<br>
 * - <b>Created pixels should be easy to delete</b> <br>
